8/11/2025: Finished Wireframing for my personal website. 

I used the GoodNotes app on my iPad to do this wireframe. Although there are alternatives such as Figma, I prefer the fluidity of being able to draw things out on my iPad. 

The plan is to use simple HTML and CSS to design this website since there really is no need for a backend. 

I used various sources as inspiration for the design aspects of my website, including Pinterest and Youtube. What makes sense the most to me is to have a Nav bar to allow the user to easily navigate between pages and having a separate page for each major topic.
